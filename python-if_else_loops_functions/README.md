# python-if_else_loops_functions:

## Description:

The Python - if/else, loops, functions project is tailored for novice learners, offering a structured introduction to essential Python concepts. Led by Guillaume, this project provides hands-on exercises focusing on if/else statements, loops, and functions, all crucial building blocks in Python programming.

## Learning Objectives:

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google.

## General:

- Why indentation is so important in Python
- How to use the if, if ... else statements
- How to use comments
- How to affect values to variables
- How to use the while and for loops
- How to use the break and continues statements
- How to use else clauses on loops
- What does the pass statement do, and when to use it
- How to use range
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What does return a function that does not use any return statement
- Scope of variables
- Whatâ€™s a traceback
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

## Requirements:

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.\*)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.\*)

## Mandatory tasks:

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

#### Description:

This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.

#### Instructions:

- You don't need to understand what `import`, `random.randint` do. Please do not touch this code.
- The variable `number` will store a different value every time you run this program.
- The output of the program should be:
- The number, followed by:
- if the number is greater than 0: is positive
- if the number is 0: is zero
- if the number is less than 0: is negative
- followed by a new line

##### Example:

$ ./0-positive_or_negative.py \
-4 is negative\
$ ./0-positive_or_negative.py \
0 is zero\
$ ./0-positive_or_negative.py \
-3 is negative

### 1. The last digit

#### Description:

This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`.

#### Instructions:

- You don't need to understand what `import`, `random.randint` do. Please do not touch this code. This line should not change: `number = random.randint(-10000, 10000)`
- The output of the program should be:
- The string "Last digit of", followed by
- the number, followed by
- the string "is", followed by the last digit of `number`, followed by:
- if the last digit is greater than 5: the string "and is greater than 5"
- if the last digit is 0: the string "and is 0"
- if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string "and is less than 6 and not 0"
- followed by a new line

##### Example:

$ ./1-last_digit.py\
Last digit of 4205 is 5 and is less than 6 and not 0\
