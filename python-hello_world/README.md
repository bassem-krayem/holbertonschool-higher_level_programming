# Python hello world:

## Description:

The Python - Hello, World project is designed to introduce beginners to Python programming by demonstrating fundamental concepts through a series of script tasks. The project aims to provide hands-on experience with Python syntax, basic operations, and best practices, while encouraging learners to explore different approaches to problem-solving.

### Key Objectives:

1. Introduction to Python: The project starts with simple tasks to familiarize learners with basic Python syntax and programming concepts.
2. Printing Output: Learners will practice using the `print` function to display text and variable values in the terminal.
3. String Manipulation: Tasks involve working with strings, including concatenation, slicing, and formatting.
4. Variable Operations: Learners will perform operations on variables, including integers and floats, to understand data manipulation in Python.
5. Coding Standards: The project emphasizes adhering to Python's official coding style guide (PEP8) and using tools like `pycodestyle` to ensure clean and readable code.

## Learning Objectives:

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google.

## General:

• How to use the Python interpreter
• How to print text and variables using print
• How to use strings
• What are indexing and slicing in Python
• What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle.

## Requirements:

### Python Scripts:

• Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
• All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8._)
• All your files should end with a new line
• The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
• A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
• A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
• Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7._)
• All your files must be executable
• The length of your files will be tested using wc.
